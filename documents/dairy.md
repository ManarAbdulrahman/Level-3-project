# Day 1
   I created a github repo along with trello board
finish listing the backlogs for the first sprint (4 days)
DoD: Creating cluster with namespaces

# Day 2 
  Puch docker images of each microservices to dockerhub 

I faild to day to finish the task ;(

# Day 3
I'll try to push the images again to dockerhub 
And try running the app
I succeeded and push the some mages to docker hub after changeing the namespace to tekton-pipelines(tekton works only in this namespace appearntly) 
some of service's dockerfiles need to be multistaged to work and i'm having a problem with that :(
